# C++haos measure
## How to run
1. Open Powershell
2. If the folder `computer_randomness` is downloaded at a `$PATH` then run
    ```powershell
    cd $PATH/computer_randomness
    ```
3. You should be able to see the below mentioned block in the powershell CLI.
   ```shell
   PS $PATH/computer_randomness>
   ```
4. Now run the following command to get the `pdf` curves of your system's integer allocation.

    ```powershell
    .\app.ps1 -n1 <Number of samples for test1> -n2 <Number of samples for test2>
    ```
    >Understand `Number of samples for a test` as the number of times you roll a dice in a random experiment to determine the probability of each face turning up. 
    Here the faces are all integers that can be generated by your computer.

## How to abort
>Press `Ctrl+C` to abort the run.

## Warnings
> Don't keep any of your personal `.csv` files in the repo as it cleans out `.csv` files in the repo before every run.

If you just want to try out the code
- Don't alter the file structure of the repository.
- Don't alter the name of any file in the repository.

## Outputs
- A 2x2 plot with top tiles showing gaussian curves with mean and variance of the gennerated data and bottom tiles showing the histograms of the generated data.
- Mean and variance of each dataset will be printed to console.
